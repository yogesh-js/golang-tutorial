/*
Mutex is a mutual exclusion lock. The zero
value fo Mutex is an unlocked mutex.

It looks the memory , so when one goroutine is writing
something in the memory it will not allow anything else to write on it

Similarly for RWMutex
While one operation is being running it will run until interrupted
